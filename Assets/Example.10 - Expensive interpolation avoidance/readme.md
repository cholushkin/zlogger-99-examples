# Expensive Interpolation Avoidance

ZLogger provides a powerful way to avoid unnecessary computation in logging by deferring expensive string interpolation until it's certain that a log message will be written. This sample shows how to apply that technique in a Unity environment using custom extension methods.

## Features Demonstrated

- Deferred logging using `Func<string>` to avoid expensive calculations.
- Logger extensions for multiple log levels (Info, Warning, Error, etc.).
- Real example of an expensive calculation being skipped when log level is not enabled.
- Setup of a logger with ZLogger in Unity, including pretty stack trace formatting.

## Summary

This example illustrates how to improve performance in logging-heavy applications by leveraging deferred evaluation. By using ZLoggerâ€™s ability to delay string interpolation, developers can skip expensive operations unless the message is actually going to be logged, resulting in cleaner and more efficient code.
